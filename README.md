OMG, just finished Plankton: The Movie and honestly, like, I have soooo many feelings about it. You know what I mean? 😂 Plankton was weirdly epic, like who even knew he had so much going on inside that tiny, evil little heart? 

And don’t get me started on that part where SpongeBob just goes full-on superhero 𝘮𝘰𝘥e. I mean, weren't they just cleaning up a kitchen like five minutes before the battle? So random, but I’m here for it. It’s not every day you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   on a whim and it just blows your mind with nonsense. 

> Also, the soundtrack, right? Kind of surprised me. Like, when did they start using epic orchestral beats for a plankton  ? 😂 Seriously thought my headphones were gonna explode, lol. Actually, wait, here’s a thought: imagine this as an audio-only experience. Would it still be epic? I’m not sure but I kinda wanna try it.

That scene when Plankton remembers his childhood dreams 😂 - wasn't he created in a lab or something? The writers were just YOLO-ing through the script, I swear. And the whole emotional swing gave me whiplash. One moment you're crying, next, you’re laughing like a lunatic.

Anyway, glad I got to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ; it was definitely a rollercoaster. Oh, and I almost forgot - the unexpected plot twist: Karen being the secret mastermind?? Classic! I mean, she’s always been the brains, but still. 🤯 Had to pause for a sec to process that...

console.log('Why did I just write this here?');

Man, my brain's all over the place now. Gonna go re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 some safe, boring stuff to calm down. Still buzzing from that ending though, haha. Let me know what you think if you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it. 🍿
